## KUBERNETES REPLICAS, SERVICES AND DEPLOYMENT

### ReplicaSet
Using the kubernetes documentation - A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a 
stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.
This is another way of saying that a replicaSet is a way of ensuring or guaranteeing that
that a specific number of pod is running.

To define a replicaSet, a selector on how to identify a particular pod to acquire
is always specified.
